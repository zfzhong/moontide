## 1. Portfolio Structure
- **Total capital**: $500,000  
- **Risk sleeve**: ~$40,000 (â‰ˆ8%) for SPX put spreads  
- **Safe sleeve**: $200,000 in SGOV (earning ~5%)  
- **Reserve sleeve**: $260,000 in cash/SGOV  

---

## 2. Trade Setup
- **Instrument**: SPX European-style index options (cash-settled).  
- **Spread type**: Bull put spread, 100 points wide.  
- **Target delta**: Short put â‰ˆ 10-delta (â‰ˆ90% probability OTM).  
- **Entry cadence**: Sell **1 new spread every Monday**, expiring ~28 days out.  
- **Ladder**: After 4 weeks, always 4 spreads live at any time.  
- **Capital at risk**: â‰ˆ$9.2k per spread Ã— 4 = â‰ˆ$37k max risk.  

---

## 3. Income Target
- **Per spread**: â‰ˆ $800 credit.  
- **4 spreads live**: â‰ˆ $3,200/month (~0.64% portfolio).  
- **SGOV yield**: â‰ˆ $10k/year (~0.2% portfolio/month).  
- **Total target**: **0.8â€“0.9% per month** portfolio-level return in calm markets.  

---

## 4. Risk Controls
1. **Max allocation**  
   - Never exceed 4 spreads live (~$40k risk).  

2. **Stop-loss rule**  
   - If spread value rises to **3Ã— credit received**, close early.  
   - Example: sold for $8 â†’ exit if value hits $24.  

3. **Event filter**  
   - Avoid opening new spreads right before **CPI, Fed, or NFP**.  
   - Skip weeks where implied volatility is abnormally low (<15%).  

4. **Crash plan**  
   - If spreads hit max loss in a crash, accept it and **close all positions**.  
   - Stop strategy temporarily.  
   - Redeploy **$200k SGOV** into SPX at crash lows to capture long-term rebound.  

---

## 5. Monitoring Checklist
- **Weekly**  
  - Confirm 4 spreads live.  
  - Check each spread vs 3Ã— credit stop.  
  - Ensure exposure â‰¤ $40k.  

- **Monthly**  
  - Log SGOV yield received.  
  - Review SPX volatility regime (adjust delta if vol shifts significantly).  

---

## 6. Mindset
- Expect **small, steady wins** most months.  
- Accept that **occasional 8% drawdowns** may happen.  
- Trust the **MoonLadder barbell**: SGOV + crash redeploy flips market shocks into opportunity.  

---

## âœ… Summary
MoonLadder = **4-spread ladder + SGOV safety net + crash redeploy option**.  
- Income target: ~0.8%/month.  
- Max risk capped at ~8% of portfolio.

## Logic connectoing to fallback to SPX
- We want to sell SPY at the striker which is about 10% down from the current price.
