## Core Principle
Mirror MoonLadder is the "twin" of MoonLadder.  
- Always **long the benchmark index (SPY/QQQ)**.

  - Buy 600 put (long-dated) â‰ˆ $5,000 cost  
  - Max loss per unit â‰ˆ $5,000  
- **Dynamic Rule:**

  - Buy 530 put (Sep 18, 2026) @ 24.3 = $2,430  
  - Max loss per unit = 4,940 + 2,430 = **$7,370**  
- **Dynamic Rule:**  
  - If QQQ climbs above ~600 â†’ Sell 650/670 call (income sleeve)  
  - If QQQ dips near 550â€“530 â†’ Hold; put limits loss

## Crash Trigger (< Put Strike)
- If SPY < 600 or QQQ < 530 â†’  
  - Protective put is ITM â†’ loss capped at risk budget.  
  - Close sleeve and **redeploy into LEAPS call spreads**:  
    - SPY or QQQ LEAPS ATM/OTM spreads (e.g., 600/700, 580/680).  
    - Stock basket LEAPS: NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, META, TSLA (ATM + 15â€“20% OTM).  
- Goal: turn crashes into **convex upside opportunities**.
