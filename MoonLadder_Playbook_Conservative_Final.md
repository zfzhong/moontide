- **Strike rule**: Short put â‰ˆ 12â€“18% below current SPX (deep OTM)  
- **Expiry**: 3 months (â‰ˆ90 days)  
- **Exit rule**: Close each spread 3 weeks before expiry (â‰ˆ9-week holding)  
- **Entry cadence**: Sell 1 new spread every 3 weeks  
- **Ladder**: Always 3 live spreads (never 4)  
- **Capital at risk**: 3 spreads Ã— ~$7â€“8k = ~$20â€“25k total (â‰ˆ5% of portfolio)

## 3. Income Target
- **Per spread**: $600â€“900 collected (closing early)  
- **3 spreads live**: â‰ˆ $2,100â€“2,700/month (~0.4â€“0.5% of portfolio)  
- **SGOV yield**: â‰ˆ $10k/year (~$830/month, 0.15â€“0.2%)  
- **Total target**: ~0.5â€“0.7% portfolio return per month in calm markets  

---

## 4. Risk Controls
1. **Max allocation**: Never exceed $25k risk (~5% of portfolio)  
2. **Stop-loss rule**: Close if spread value rises to 3Ã— credit received  
   - Example: sold for $10 â†’ exit if value hits $30  
3. **Event filter**: Avoid entering before CPI, Fed, or NFP; skip weeks if implied volatility <15%  
4. **Crash plan**: If spreads hit max loss, accept it, close all, pause strategy, and redeploy $200k SGOV into SPX at lows  

---

## 5. Monitoring Checklist
- **Weekly**: confirm 3 spreads live, risk per spread â‰¤ $8k, total â‰¤ $25k, check vs stop rule  
- **Monthly**: log SGOV interest, review SPX volatility, adjust strikes to remain 12â€“18% OTM  

---

## 6. Mindset
- Target steady ~0.5% monthly returns, not maximum income  
- Accept occasional 5% drawdowns  
- Trust the **MoonLadder barbell**: SGOV + crash redeploy flips shocks into opportunity
