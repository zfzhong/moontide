## ✅ Weekly 4-Week Rolling Ladder
- **Entry**: Every Friday → Sell new SPX put spread expiring in 5 weeks  
- **Exit**: Close after 4 weeks (≈1 week before expiry)  
- **Ladder**: Always 4 concurrent spreads live  
- **Risk Cap**: ≤ $30k (≈6% of portfolio)  
- **Example**: SPX 6500 → Sell 6000p, Buy 5925p (credit ≈ $360, net ≈ $325)  
- **Income**: Weekly ≈ $325 → Monthly ≈ $1,300–1,600  
- **Add SGOV**: ≈ $720/month (0.36% of $200k)  
- **Total Income**: ≈ $2,020–2,320/month (~0.40–0.46% portfolio)

## ⚠️ Crash Redeploy Plan (LEAPS)
- **Trigger**: SPX −10% or more from recent highs  
- **Step 1**: Accept spread sleeve loss (max $25–30k)  
- **Step 2**: Redeploy ~$50–70k reserve into 24–30 month LEAPS call spreads  
  - **Index LEAPS**: SPX or SPY ATM/OTM call spreads (e.g., 6500/6900)  
  - **Stock LEAPS**: NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, META, TSLA (ATM/OTM spreads, 24–30m), $5–10k each  
- **Reserve**: Keep $200k+ in SGOV/cash for deeper redeploy (SPX −20%)  
- **Purpose**: Shallow crash → LEAPS offset spread losses; Deep crash → asymmetric profits
