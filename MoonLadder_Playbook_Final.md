## 2. Weekly 4-Week Rolling Ladder

### Setup
- **Entry**: Every Friday, sell a new SPX put spread expiring in 5 weeks.  
- **Exit**: Close after 4 weeks (â‰ˆ1 week before expiry).  
- **Ladder**: Always 4 concurrent spreads live.  

### Example (SPX 6500, Sell 6000/5925 Put Spread)
- **Credit**: â‰ˆ $360 gross, â‰ˆ $325 net after early exit  
- **Max loss**: â‰ˆ $7,140  
- **Risk sleeve**: 4 spreads Ã— $7,140 = $28.5k (~5.7% portfolio)  
- **Weekly harvest**: â‰ˆ $325  
- **Monthly income**: â‰ˆ $1,300â€“1,600  
- **Add SGOV yield**: â‰ˆ $720/month  
- **Total portfolio income**: â‰ˆ $2,020â€“2,320/month (~0.40â€“0.46%)  

### Benefits
- Risk sleeve stays under $30k cap.  
- Removes last-week gamma/volatility risk.  
- Predictable weekly cadence and steady income.

## 3. Crash Redeploy Plan (LEAPS)

If SPX falls **â‰¥10% from recent highs**:  

1. Accept spread sleeve loss (max $25â€“30k).  
2. Redeploy ~$50â€“70k of reserve into **24â€“30 month LEAPS call spreads**:  
   - **Index LEAPS**: SPX or SPY ATM/OTM spreads (e.g., 6500/6900).  
   - **Stock Basket LEAPS**: NVDA, MSFT, AAPL, AMZN, META, TSLA. Buy ATM, sell 15â€“20% OTM. $5â€“10k per stock.  
3. Keep the remainder ($200k+) in SGOV/cash to deploy further if SPX âˆ’20% or deeper.  

### Purpose
- Shallow crash (âˆ’10%): LEAPS rebound offsets spread loss.  
- Deep crash (âˆ’20%+): LEAPS deliver large asymmetric profits, turning crisis into opportunity.
